# cyberbully
Cyberbullying poses significant challenges to the mental well-being of individuals, particularly among younger populations. Existing detection systems often fail to consider critical aspects such as repetition, intent to harm, and peerness of interactions, focusing instead on isolated instances of aggression.

This project aims to develop a robust machine-learning pipeline to classify user interactions as cyberbullying or non-cyberbullying. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset containing user demographics, communication patterns, message content, and relational factors like peerness, the goal is to build a model that accurately predicts cyberbullying labels. The output can aid social platforms and educators in early intervention and prevention efforts.
